# Dragons info App

This Fullstack app (SPA React.js + Node.js with MonogoDB) allows you to receive
current information about spacecrafts by SpaceX named Dragons.

## Main functionality

- Authorisation: registration or login for registered users, logout.
- Getting up-to-date information about dragons for authorized users: Dragons
  list and more details about each of them
- This is basic functionality that can be expanded

## Implementation

### Backend (Authorisation) - Node.js + MongoDB

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/YarPetru/spacex-spacecrafts-backend)
Backend deployed on
[heroku](https://spacex-spacecrafts-backend.herokuapp.com/api/). All changes on
github branch are automaticaly deployed on Heroku. If you want to run the app in
production/developer mode on your computer remember to change the
"axios.defaults.baseURL" in Frontend part to "http://localhost:9999/".

Backend created using basic security terms such as password encryption during
data transfer and user-friendly error-handling in frontend. But e.g. in case of
an incorrect login user receives message "Email or password is wrong" to make
hacking a bit more difficult ðŸ˜….
